Yet To Do:

    Remove hacky compilation with boost-program-options (IT'S BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!)

    Check that the input file exists

    Add -h and --help options that print usage.

    Add logging - verbosity flag
        Proposed Boost.Log is too heavy for our purposes
        Just using std::clog

    Add support for receiving input on stdin and outputting to stdout (will help with web version a lot)

    Check for other file errors
        Output file exists
        Can't write to output file
        Can't read from the input file
        Catch GraphicsMagick errors

    CGI/PHP website on EOS

    Go through functions and optimize code/check for memory leaks

    Document compilation and installation procedure

    ???Remove Makefile???

    Doxygen documentation.

    Windows compatability

    Modify Chuck Close algorithm to read from memory (Blob)

    libtransmogrify
	Create static and shared library
	Python binding
