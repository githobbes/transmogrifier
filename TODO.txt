Yet To Do:

    Add logging to image processing

    Add transmogrifier namespace

    Remove hacky compilation with boost-program-options (IT'S BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!)
    Windows compatability

    Add support for receiving input on stdin and outputting to stdout (will help with web version a lot)

    Check for other file errors
        Output file exists
        Can't write to output file
        Can't read from the input file
        Catch GraphicsMagick errors

    Go through functions and optimize code/check for memory leaks (use Valgrind)

    Document compilation and installation procedure (with Sphinx/Doxygen)

    Doxygen documentation.

    Modify Chuck Close algorithm to read from memory (Blob)

    Chuck Close support images should be compiled in executable
