Yet To Do:

   Add support for receiving input on stdin and outputting to stdout (will help with web version a lot)
       stdin is done
       stdout will require explicitly stating the format on the command-line

    Remove hacky compilation with boost-program-options (IT'S BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!)
    Windows compatability
        Look at GraphicsMagick Magick++ demos
        Write a hello world with Visual Studio and Visual C++
        Write a hello world program with SCons
 
    Check for other file errors
        Output file exists
        Can't write to output file
        Can't read from the input file
        Catch GraphicsMagick errors

    Go through functions and optimize code/check for memory leaks (use Valgrind)

    Document compilation and installation procedure (with Sphinx/Doxygen)

    Doxygen documentation.

    Modify Chuck Close algorithm to read from memory (Blob)

    Chuck Close support images should be compiled in executable

    libtransmogrify
	Create static and shared library
	Python binding
